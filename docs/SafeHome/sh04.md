## Considering First Prototype

As prototype development occurs, you should carefully consider the software archi- tectural choices you make. It is relatively inexpensive to change a few lines of code if you catch errors before deployment. It is very expensive to change the architecture of a software application once it has been released to end users around the globe.

## Evaluating First Prototype

Testing is conducted by the developers as the prototype is being built and becomes an important part of prototype evaluation. Testing demonstrates that prototype com- ponents are operational, but itâ€™s unlikely that test cases will have found all the defects.
